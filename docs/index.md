# About this website

Welcome to the DeepLearning.AI Companion website! I started this project to keep detailed notes and reviews for various short courses offered by DeepLearning.AI as I finished these courses. However, I soon realized that this could be a valuable resource for others who are looking to learn skills related the growing field of [AI Engineering](https://www.latent.space/p/ai-engineer). So, I decided to convert my notes and reviews into a website that could be easily accessible to anyone interested, as well as to turn this into a community project so that others can request for features and add their own learnings.

## Features

### [Course Notes](notes/preprocessing-unstructured-data-for-llm-applications)
Explore comprehensive notes and reviews for each course, covering key concepts, practical applications, and major takeaways.

### [Course Reviews](reviews/preprocessing-unstructured-data-for-llm-applications)
My personal review of the courses: their good and bas aspects, as well as who the traget audience should be.

### Coming Soon: [Learning Paths]
Discover the best sequence of courses to take based on your interests and goals. Use our interactive flowcharts to navigate through different learning paths.

### [Tags](Tags)
Filter courses by topic using our tagging system. Find the content most relevant to your needs quickly and efficiently.
